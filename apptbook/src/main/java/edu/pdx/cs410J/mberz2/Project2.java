/**
 * This is the main class method for the CS410J Appointment Book Project.
 * <p>The program simulates the receiving an appointment via command line
 * arguments and proceeds through operations to validate the input, process
 * a limited number of options, and then creates an {@code Appointment} and
 * {@code AppointmentBook} object. </p>
 * <p>If the print flag is enabled, it will print back the
 * details of the appointment.</p>
 * <p>If the readme flag is enabled, it will print the README.txt file that
 * is located in the resources.</p>
 * <p>If the textfile flag is enabled, it will read in any appointments stored
 * in a given text file, and write the new appointment to it.</p>
